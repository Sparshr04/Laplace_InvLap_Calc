# Laplace_InvLap_Calc
This is a simple Calculator to calculate Laplace Transform and Inverse Laplace Transform of a function.
<br>
A basic and simple use of sympy library 
<br>
<b> If the Function is large or complex</b> then use the Partial Fractions of Polynomial Multiplication functions to bsimplify the Question.
<br>
Then Individually Calculate the Laplace Transform. The same goes for Inverse Laplace Transform.
